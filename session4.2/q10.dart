/*
Employee Payroll System
Implement an employee payroll system.
Create a base Employee class with properties: name, id, and salary.
Implement a method calculateSalary() in the base class.
Create two subclasses:
- FullTimeEmployee: Adds a bonus and overrides calculateSalary() to include the bonus.
- PartTimeEmployee: Adds hoursWorked and hourlyRate, overriding calculateSalary() to compute
salary based on hours worked */

import 'employee.dart';

void main() {
  FullTimeEmployee fullTimeEmployee = FullTimeEmployee(
    name: 'humam',
    id: 1,
    salary: 2000,
    bonus: 1000,
  );
  print('FullTimeEmployee: ${fullTimeEmployee.calculateSalary()}');

  PartTimeEmployee partTimeEmployee = PartTimeEmployee(
    name: 'ahmed',
    id: 2,
    hoursWorked: 20,
    hourlyRate: 30,
  );
  print("PartTimeEmployee: ${partTimeEmployee.calculateSalary()}");
