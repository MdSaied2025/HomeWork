/* Question 15
What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
impact the way variables are used? */


// Statically Typed Languages	
/* 
-Type checking is completed at compile time	
-Explicit type declarations are usually required	
-Errors are detected earlier	
-Variable assignments are static and cannot be changed	
-Produces more optimized code
